        <P>BTS (Korean: Î∞©ÌÉÑÏÜåÎÖÑÎã®; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan; lit. Bulletproof Boy Scouts), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a South Korean boy band formed in 2010. The band consists of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook, who co-write or co-produce much of their material. Originally a hip hop group, they expanded their musical style to incorporate a wide range of genres, while their lyrics have focused on subjects including mental health, the troubles of school-age youth and coming of age, loss, the journey towards self-love, individualism, and the consequences of fame and recognition. Their discography and adjacent work has also referenced literature, philosophy and psychology, and includes an alternate universe storyline.</P>

        <P>Lyrically, ‚ÄúSpring Day‚Äù is wonderfully poetic, and the tone of its lyrics matches the tone of the song so well. Both are delicately sentimental and melancholy, but at the same time instill in the listener a sense of hope and peace.
